                            I first began working at Six Flags St. Louis when I was 16 years old in March of 2011.
                            Six Flags represented my first legitimate job, and as such I was entirely unsure of what to expect as far as wages or treatment.
                            I was hired on as a Rides Operator for the Batman. Needless to say I as excited as it was one of my favorite rides.
                            Ultimately my tenure at Six Flags came to an abrupt end nearly 8 months after it began due to a higher up seeking to make an example of me for a remarkably trivial offense.
                            Thankfully I had put forth my two weeks notice over a week before hand and had only 2 days left scheduled.

                        <p>
                            I next, after a 2 year sabatical of simply highschool, was hired at House Springs Dollar General in June of 2013.
                            Dollar General while not a sizeable increase in pay over that of Six Flags, it still represented a sizeable milestone at the time as being my first job that payed greater than minimum wage.
                            Dollar General: an inside, air conditioned retail environment; represented a nice change of pace from the outdoor working environment afforded by Six Flags.
                            The relative poshness of a retail job, one so close to my home, lulled me into a sense of complacency.
                            I stayed at Dollar General for almost 2 years, making it up to key carrier, and quite nearly Assistant Manager.
                            Ultimately I left Dollar General in April of 2015, due to scheduling conflictions with that of my schooling.

                        <p>
                            Next I transitioned into a truck unloader position at the local High Ridge Walmart, that I was referred to by a close friend.
                            Walmart, while a relatively sizeable pay increase over that of Dollar General as well as a much more flexible schedule was not destined to last very long.
                            I spent a total of 2 months working at Walmart between July and September of 2015.
                            I felt that I was forced to tender my resignation as I was unable to work with my direct supervisors and their mthods of communication.

                            Thankfully while I was butting heads with Walmart's management I was offered a higher paying position as the Assistant Store Manager of Arnold Dollar General.
                            The store manager was a personal friend of mine whom I had worked with on numerous occasions at other Dollar Generals in the past.
                            I began working for her at her store nearly a month before I had even stopped being scheduled at Walmart as she was in desperate need of workers.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I started work at Arnold Dollar General in August of 2015, and just like the last time, allowed myself to become all too consumed by it.
                            The continued onslaught of highschool level drama and intrastore rumors, while horrendous eventually left me with a remarkablely rounded understanding of how to comport myself in the workplace though.
                            Overrall, when I left Dollar General in March of 2016, it may have been turmultuous as well as utterly enraging at the time; upon looking back it was a remarkable learning experience.
                            It also marked the first time I swore to myself that I would never be trapped in a job such as this like many of the people that I had worked with and for.

                            My next place of employment was a brief stint as a Sale Associate for The Cellular Connection; a subsidiary of a subsidiary of Verizon.
                            While in theory, the job seemed exciting to me as it seemed to promise high pay, as the job was comission based, as well as being inarguably more tech focused than any of the other jobs I had in the past.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Much to my naive surprise the job was not in the slightest tech focused but was through and through a sales job.
                            One in which, because I was comission based, I was expected to meet a quota of phones, tablets, data plans, etc per month or risk being let go.
                            This all on top of discovering that I would be expected to fill scheduling holes in their most distant location, in Granite City, over one hour from my home.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Needless to say, my disapproval with the commute as well as the core requirements of the position required that I tender my resignation.
                            I ultimately left my employment with the subsidiary of TCC in spetember of 2016; less than 2 months into my employment.

                            After Dollar General I spent a small amount of time at a series of different small businesses such as a local family owned grocery store in which I was an assistant to the head meat cutter.
                            This didn't last long as they were seeking a full-time union worker with aims of becoming a meat cutter.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I also had a short time spent working at an elder care facility in Cedar Hill. I worked in their kitchen, serving the drinks as well as helping in preparation for lunch and dinner for the nearly 300 residents.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Each of these jobs was punctuated by various tasks of menial labor here and there for family members for small amounts of cash.

                            Most recently I began working at the Fenton Autozone, August 2017, while I finished up the last of my associates degree at Jefferson Community College.
                            AutoZone, just like many of my coworkers cautioned me to do, was supposed to be a very short employment.
                            I spent a total of only 6 months at AutoZone, my last day on the 25th of March, so that I might transition into the next chapter of my working life.
